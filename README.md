This is my repo for my first rice, which I am calling "whitewash." It is a slightly monochrome theme that honestly isn't very easy on the eyes, but the wallpaper looks nice and I honestly think I nailed it with the top bar in dwm.

Oh by the way, I'm using Suckless software for this as much as possible. I haven't figured out Surf just yet, but other than that, we have dwm, dmenu, st, slock, and slstatus maintaining everything here.
